This dataset, entitled ‘World Important Events - Ancient to Modern’, covers major historical events from ancient civilisations to contemporary periods, and encompasses a wide range of global incidents. 
It provides a detailed chronology of events that have shaped history, from wars and cultural advances to social and technological change. 
This dataset is a valuable resource for exploring the impact of historical events on human development, civilisations and, in the context of our project, on cultural trends in cinema.

## Column Descriptions:

Sl. No: Event serial number.
Name of Incident: Title or name of the historical event.
Date, Month, Year: Precise date (if known) of the event.
Country: Country where the event occurred.
Type of Event: Nature of the event (e.g. war, revolution, technological advance).
Place Name: Specific place where the event took place.
Impact: Brief description of the impact or consequences of the event.
Affected Population: Population affected by the event.
Important Person/Group Responsible: Key persons or groups involved in the event.

## Intended use for the project

This dataset will enable us to establish correlations between historical events and trends in film genres. 
Using information on date, location, type of event, and impact, we will be able to:

- Associate periods of crisis or conflict (such as wars) with the genres popular in those periods (for example, war films or dramas).
- Analyse global cultural trends: observing how certain historical events, such as liberation movements or major discoveries, influence the film genres produced in subsequent decades.
- Study cultural diffusion and the effects of globalisation: by examining how certain genres become global after significant events in the United States or other influential countries.

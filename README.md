# Title
Historical and sociocultural analysis of film genre trends: impact of world events and box office successes

## Abstract: 

This project aims to explore the historical evolution of film genres, examining how societal and historical contexts influence trends in cinema. 
By analyzing the impact of major world events, we seek to understand how periods of conflict, economic upheaval, or stability shape audience preferences and genre popularity. For instance, we will investigate whether genres like war films or escapist comedies surge during turbulent times. Additionally, we will assess the influence of American culture and globalization on international cinema, examining how trends in U.S. films impact global production. 
Lastly, we’ll analyze how box office successes shape genre proliferation, investigating if highly successful films lead to a rise in similar productions. This research aims to uncover the interplay between cinema, historical context, and cultural diffusion, telling a broader story of how global and national phenomena shape what audiences see on screen.

## Research Questions:

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

## Proposed additional datasets (if any):
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

## Methods

## Proposed timeline

--> 03/11: Have found a complementary dataset containing the historical events we want to analyze, and consider its use: for example, do we recognize keywords such as “war” or “politics”, and check whether our analysis method is feasible?
Or have chosen if we want to create it ourselves, by selecting the events that interest us.

--> 05/11: Check whether the project is feasible by carrying out primary analyses.



## Questions for TAs (optional): 
Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.

    "To continue this project and further push our analysis, we need to find a way to group certain genres and event types together. Additionally, we will explore how to quantify the significance of each event more thoroughly to retain only the most relevant ones. This approach will simplify our analysis, allowing us to identify potential connections between genres and events. We may also investigate whether a film relates to a particular historical event by examining its plot.\n",

    "It could also be interesting to pose some hypotheses on the distribution of our variables and how they influence one another. For example, we could imagine that the rise in wars in a given country could lead to an increase in movie releases with war-related genres. It could therefore be interesting to assess the statistical significance of historical events as factors for trends in movie releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach could be to analyze correlations between historical event frequencies (e.g., wars, economic crises) and the prevalence of certain movie genres over time. This would involve computing correlation coefficients or using regression models to quantify the strength of these relationships. For instance, we could test whether an increase in war-related events correlates with an increase in war-themed movies, controlling for other variables such as economic conditions and popular culture trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, hypothesis testing can help verify whether observed trends are statistically significant or likely due to random variation. For example, we could set up a hypothesis test to see if the proportion of war-related movies significantly increases following war periods compared to stable periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to enhance interpretability, clustering techniques might help categorize similar trends and patterns within the dataset, allowing us to identify genres that respond similarly to specific types of historical events. This could reveal latent relationships within our data that might be overlooked in simple pairwise analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods would give us a more robust understanding of how external events might act as drivers or influencers of movie genre trends, allowing us to make informed conclusions about the cultural impact of historical contexts on film production."
